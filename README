NAME
    Color::Swatch::ASE::Writer - Low level ASE ( Adobe Swatch Exchange )
    file Writer.

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
      use Color::Swatch::ASE::Writer;
      my $structure = {
        blocks => [
          { type => 'group_start', label => 'My Colour Swatch' },
          { type => 'color', model => 'RGB ', values => [ 0.1 , 0.5, 0.9 ]},
          { type => 'color', model => 'RGB ', values => [ 0.9 , 0.5, 0.1 ]},
          { type => 'group_end' },
        ]
      };

      Color::Swatch::ASE::Writer->write_file(q[./myfile.ase], $structure );

    This at present is very low-level simple structure encoding, and is
    probably not useful to most people.

    Its based on the reverse-engineered specification of Adobe™'s "Swatch
    Exchange" format, which can be found documented many places:
