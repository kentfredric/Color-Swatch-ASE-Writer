# NAME

Color::Swatch::ASE::Writer - Low level ASE ( Adobe Swatch Exchange ) file Writer.

# VERSION

version 0.001000

# SYNOPSIS

    use Color::Swatch::ASE::Writer;
    my $structure = {
      blocks => [
        { type => 'group_start', label => 'My Colour Swatch' },
        { type => 'color', model => 'RGB ', values => [ 0.1 , 0.5, 0.9 ]},
        { type => 'color', model => 'RGB ', values => [ 0.9 , 0.5, 0.1 ]},
        { type => 'group_end' },
      ]
    };

    Color::Swatch::ASE::Writer->write_file(q[./myfile.ase], $structure );

This at present is very low-level simple structure encoding, and is probably not useful to most people.

Its based on the reverse-engineered specification of Adobeâ„¢'s "Swatch Exchange" format, which can be found documented many places:
